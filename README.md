# _e-vignette_

## What is an e-vignette?

An e-vignette is a modern toll payment method for motor vehicles with a maximum permissible weight of up to 3500 kg.
The basic characteristics of the e-vignette are not very different from the classic vignette in the form of a sticker.
This means that by purchasing the e-vignette, you get the right to use all motorways and expressways in the
Republic of Slovenia for the e-vignette validity period and the toll is not paid based on the distance driven.  
  
**Vehicles without a valid e-vignette may not enter a toll road.**  
  
**The e-vignette is linked to the vehicle registration plate number. When purchasing the e-vignette,
you need to enter the correct registration plate number and country of your vehicle registration, and
choose an e-vignette for the right toll class.** If the registration number in the e-vignette system does
not match the registration plate number of the vehicle driving on the motorway or expressway, the toll is not
deemed to be paid. The customer is responsible for entering a correct registration plate number and selecting
an appropriate toll class.  

## Where is an e-vignette mandatory?

A valid e-vignette for the correct toll class is mandatory for all motor vehicles with a maximum permissible weight
of up to 3500 kg when entering a toll road. This means that you need to buy an e-vignette and select the start date
of its validity before you enter the motorway or expressway.

An e-vignette is required for driving on all motorways and expressways operated by DARS, with the exception of certain sections:

-   **The Gorenjska motorway (A2)** – from the direction of Austria to the Hrušica junction in the direction towards Slovenia, and
    from the Hrušica junction to the border in the direction of Austria. The toll for this section is paid together with the toll
    for the Karavanke tunnel and covers the section between the first motorway junctions on both sides of the border
    (the Hrušica junction in Slovenia; the Podrožca - Rosenbach junction in Austria).
-   **The Koper expressway (H6)** – from the Koper (Semedela) junction to the end of the H6 Koper-Lucija expressway
    (in both directions). Because the coastal road connecting Koper and Izola has been closed, an e-vignette is not required
    to use this road section (through the Markovec tunnel).
-   **Maribor expressway (H2)** – between Pesnica and Tezno. Due to road recategorisation into the regional road category,
    it is excluded from the e-vignette toll collection system.
